        <p class="para">My hobby is watching tv and playing with my friends in my free time. Whenever I come home from school I like to plaay outside after completing my home work. I am 11 years old and study in class 7th standard. Now I know very well that reading is very fun and can increase your imagination after reading my favorite book which you can see below. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Watching tv keep one always happy and busy. It is the good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in the life.
